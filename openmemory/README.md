# OpenMemory

OpenMemory is your personal memory layer for LLMs - private, portable, and open-source. Your memories live locally, giving you complete control over your data. Build AI applications with personalized memories while keeping your data secure.

## Easy Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- OpenAI API Key

You can quickly run OpenMemory by running the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mem0ai/mem0/main/openmemory/run.sh | bash
```

You should set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a global environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

You can also set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a parameter to the script:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mem0ai/mem0/main/openmemory/run.sh | OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key bash
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+ (for backend development)
- Node.js (for frontend development)
- OpenAI API Key (required for LLM interactions, run `cp api/.env.example api/.env` then change **OPENAI_API_KEY** to yours)

## Quickstart

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Before running the project, you need to configure environment variables for both the API and the UI.

You can do this in one of the following ways:

- **Manually**:  
  Create a `.env` file in each of the following directories:
  - `/api/.env`
  - `/ui/.env`

- **Using `.env.example` files**:  
  Copy and rename the example files:

  ```bash
  cp api/.env.example api/.env
  cp ui/.env.example ui/.env
  ```

#### Using LM Studio + remote Qdrant

- In `api/.env`, set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to your LM Studio OpenAI-compatible server URL (example: `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1`).
- Set `OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL` to your loaded chat model (e.g. `gemma-3-4b`).
- Set `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` to your loaded embedding model (e.g. `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`) and set `EMBEDDING_DIMS` to the correct dimension.
- Set `QDRANT_HOST`/`QDRANT_PORT` (or `QDRANT_URL`) to your Qdrant instance.

 - **Using Makefile** (if supported):  
    Run:
  
   ```bash
   make env
   ```
- #### Example `/api/.env`

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
USER=<user-id> # The User Id you want to associate the memories with 
```
- #### Example `/ui/.env`

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8765
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_ID=<user-id> # Same as the user id for environment variable in api
```

### 2. Build and Run the Project
You can run the project using the following two commands:
```bash
make build # builds the mcp server and ui
make up  # runs openmemory mcp server and ui
```

If you are using a remote Qdrant instance and do not want to run the bundled local Qdrant container, use:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.remote-qdrant.yml up --build
```

After running these commands, you will have:
- OpenMemory MCP server running at: http://localhost:8765 (API documentation available at http://localhost:8765/docs)
- OpenMemory UI running at: http://localhost:3000

If `localhost` doesn’t load on Windows (IPv6/`::1`), use `http://127.0.0.1:8765` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

#### UI not working on `localhost:3000`?

If the UI does not start properly on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), try running it manually:

```bash
cd ui
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### MCP Client Setup

Use the following one step command to configure OpenMemory Local MCP to a client. The general command format is as follows:

```bash
npx @openmemory/install local http://localhost:8765/mcp/<client-name>/sse/<user-id> --client <client-name>
```

Replace `<client-name>` with the desired client name and `<user-id>` with the value specified in your environment variables.
