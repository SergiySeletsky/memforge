## How to define configurations?

The `config` is defined as an object with two main keys:
- `vectorStore`: Specifies the vector database provider and its configuration
  - `provider`: The name of the vector database (e.g., `"qdrant"`, `"chroma"`, `"pgvector"`, `"azure_ai_search"`, `"redis"`, `"supabase"`, `"cloudflare_vectorize"`, `"langchain"`, `"memory"`)
  - `config`: A nested object containing provider-specific settings


## How to Use Config

Here's a general example of how to use the config with mem0:

```typescript
// Example for in-memory vector database (only supported in TypeScript)
import { Memory } from 'mem0ai/oss';

const config = {
  vectorStore: {
    provider: 'memory',
    config: {
      collectionName: 'memories',
      dimension: 1536,
    },
  },
};

const memory = new Memory(config);
await memory.add('Your text here', { userId: 'user', metadata: { category: 'example' } });
```

<Note>
  The in-memory vector database is only supported in the TypeScript implementation.

## Why is Config Needed?

Config is essential for:
1. Specifying which vector database to use.
2. Providing necessary connection details (e.g., host, port, credentials).
3. Customizing database-specific settings (e.g., collection name, path).
4. Ensuring proper initialization and connection to your chosen vector store.

## Master List of All Params in Config

Here's a comprehensive list of all parameters that can be used across different vector databases:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `collectionName` | Name of the collection |
| `embeddingModelDims` | Dimensions of the embedding model |
| `dimension` | Dimensions of the embedding model (for `memory` provider) |
| `host` | Host where the server is running |
| `port` | Port where the server is running |
| `url` | URL for the server |
| `apiKey` | API key for the server |
| `path` | Path for the database |
| `onDisk` | Enable persistent storage |
| `redisUrl` | URL for the Redis server |
| `username` | Username for database connection |
| `password` | Password for database connection |
| `connectionString` | PostgreSQL connection string (overrides individual parameters) |
| `indexMethod` | Vector index method (for Supabase) |
| `indexMeasure` | Distance measure for similarity search (for Supabase) |

## Customizing Config

Each vector database has its own specific configuration requirements. To customize the config for your chosen vector store:

1. Identify the vector database you want to use from [supported vector databases](./dbs).
2. Refer to the `Config` section in the respective vector database's documentation.
3. Include only the relevant parameters for your chosen database in the `config` dictionary.

## Supported Vector Databases

For detailed information on configuring specific vector databases, please visit the [Supported Vector Databases](./dbs) section. There you'll find individual pages for each supported vector store with provider-specific usage examples and configuration details.
