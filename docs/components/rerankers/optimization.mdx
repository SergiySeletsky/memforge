title: Performance Optimization
---

Optimizing reranker performance is crucial for maintaining fast search response times while improving result quality. This guide covers best practices for different reranker types.

### Candidate Set Size
The number of candidates sent to the reranker significantly impacts performance.

### Batching Strategy
Process multiple queries efficiently.

### Cohere Optimization

**Best Practices:**
- Use v3.0 models for better speed/accuracy balance
- Limit candidates to 100 or fewer
- Cache API responses when possible
- Monitor API rate limits

## Production Best Practices

1. **Model Selection**: Choose the right balance of speed vs. accuracy
2. **Resource Allocation**: Monitor CPU/GPU usage and memory consumption
3. **Error Handling**: Implement fallbacks for reranker failures
4. **Load Balancing**: Distribute reranking load across multiple instances
5. **Monitoring**: Track latency, throughput, and error rates
6. **Caching**: Cache frequent queries and model predictions
7. **Batch Processing**: Group similar queries for efficient processing
