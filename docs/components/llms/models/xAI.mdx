[xAI](https://x.ai/) develops large language models including the Grok series, trained on real-time data from X (formerly Twitter). Get your API key from the [xAI console](https://console.x.ai) and set it as `XAI_API_KEY`.

## Usage

```ts
import { Memory } from "mem0ai/oss";

const memory = new Memory({
  llm: {
    provider: "xai",
    config: {
      apiKey: process.env.XAI_API_KEY,
      model: "grok-3-beta",
      temperature: 0.1,
      maxTokens: 2000,
    },
  },
});

const messages = [
  { role: "user", content: "I'm planning to watch a movie tonight. Any recommendations?" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "How about thriller movies? They can be quite engaging." },
  { role: "user", content: "I'm not a big fan of thriller movies but I love sci-fi movies." },
  { role: "assistant", content: "Got it! I'll avoid thriller recommendations and suggest sci-fi movies in the future." },
];

await memory.add(messages, { userId: "alice", metadata: { category: "movies" } });
```
