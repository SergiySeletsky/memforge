title: Export Stored Memories
description: "Retrieve, review, and migrate user memories with structured exports."
---


Mem0 is a dynamic memory store that gives you full control over your data. Along with storing memories, it gives you the ability to retrieve, export, and migrate your data whenever you need.

This cookbook shows you how to retrieve and export your data for inspection, migration, or compliance.

---

## Setup

```typescript
import MemoryClient from 'mem0ai';

const client = new MemoryClient({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });
```

<Note>
Your API key needs export permissions to download memory data. Check your project settings on the [dashboard](https://app.mem0.ai) if export operations fail with authentication errors.
</Note>

Let's add some sample memories to work with:

```typescript
// Dev's work history
await client.add(
  'Dev works at TechCorp as a senior engineer',
  { userId: 'dev', metadata: { type: 'professional' } }
);

// Arjun's preferences
await client.add(
  'Arjun prefers morning meetings and async communication',
  { userId: 'arjun', metadata: { type: 'preference' } }
);

// Carl's project notes
await client.add(
  'Carl is leading the API redesign project, targeting Q2 launch',
  { userId: 'carl', metadata: { type: 'project' } }
);
```

---

## Getting All Memories

Use `get_all()` with filters to retrieve everything for a specific user:

```typescript
const devMemories = await client.getAll({
  filters: { userId: 'dev' },
  pageSize: 50
});

console.log(`Total memories: ${devMemories['count']}`);
console.log(`First memory: ${devMemories['results'][0]['memory']}`);
```

**Output:**

```
Total memories: 1
First memory: Dev works at TechCorp as a senior engineer

```

<Info>
**Expected output:** `get_all()` retrieved Dev's complete memory record. This method returns everything matching your filters—no semantic search, no ranking, just raw retrieval. Perfect for exports and audits.
</Info>

You can filter by metadata to get specific types:

```typescript
const carlProjects = await client.getAll({
  filters: {
    AND: [
      { userId: 'carl' },
      { metadata: { type: 'project' } }
    ]
  }
});

for (const memory of carlProjects['results']) {
  console.log(memory['memory']);
}
```

**Output:**

```
Carl is leading the API redesign project, targeting Q2 launch

```

---

## Searching Memories

When you need semantic search instead of retrieving everything, use `search()`:

```typescript
const results = await client.search(
  'What does Dev do for work?',
  { filters: { userId: 'dev' }, topK: 5 }
);

for (const result of results['results']) {
  console.log(`${result['memory']} (score: ${result['score'].toFixed(2)})`);
}
```

**Output:**

```
Dev works at TechCorp as a senior engineer (score: 0.89)

```

Search works across all memory fields and ranks by relevance. Use it when you have a specific question, use `get_all()` when you need everything.

---

## Exporting to Structured Format

For migrations or compliance, you can export memories into a structured schema using Pydantic-style JSON schemas.

### Step 1: Define the schema

```typescript
const professionalProfileSchema = {
  properties: {
    full_name: {
      type: 'string' as const,
      description: "The person's full name"
    },
    current_role: {
      type: 'string' as const,
      description: 'Current job title or role'
    },
    company: {
      type: 'string' as const,
      description: 'Current employer'
    }
  },
  title: 'ProfessionalProfile',
  type: 'object' as const
};
```

### Step 2: Create export job

```typescript
const exportJob = await client.createMemoryExport({
  schema: professionalProfileSchema,
  filters: { userId: 'dev' }
});

console.log(`Export ID: ${exportJob['id']}`);
console.log(`Status: ${exportJob['status']}`);
```

**Output:**

```
Export ID: exp_abc123
Status: processing

```

<Info>
**Export initiated:** Status is "processing". Large exports may take a few seconds. Poll with `get_memory_export()` until status changes to "completed" before downloading data.
</Info>

### Step 3: Download the export

```typescript
// Get by ID
const exportData = await client.getMemoryExport({
  memoryExportId: exportJob['id']
});

console.log(exportData['data']);
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "full_name": "Dev",
  "current_role": "senior engineer",
  "company": "TechCorp"
}

```

You can also retrieve exports by filters:

```typescript
// Get latest export matching filters
const exportByFilters = await client.getMemoryExport({
  filters: { userId: 'dev' }
});

console.log(exportByFilters['data']);
```

## Adding Export Instructions

Guide how Mem0 resolves conflicts or formats the export:

```typescript
const exportWithInstructions = await client.createMemoryExport({
  schema: professionalProfileSchema,
  filters: { userId: 'arjun' },
  exportInstructions: `
1. Use the most recent information if there are conflicts
2. Only include confirmed facts, not speculation
3. Return null for missing fields rather than guessing
`
});
```

<Tip>
Always check export status before downloading. Call `get_memory_export()` in a loop with a short delay until `status == "completed"`. Attempting to download while still processing returns incomplete data.
</Tip>

---

## Platform Export

You can also export memories directly from the Mem0 platform UI:

1. Navigate to **Memory Exports** in your project dashboard
2. Click **Create Export**
3. Select your filters and schema
4. Download the completed export as JSON

This is useful for one-off exports or manual data reviews.

<Warning>
Exported data expires after 7 days. Download and store exports locally if you need long-term archives. After expiration, you'll need to recreate the export job.
</Warning>

---

## What You Built

A complete memory export system with multiple retrieval methods:

- **Bulk retrieval (get_all)** - Fetch all memories matching filters for comprehensive audits
- **Semantic search** - Query-based lookups with relevance scoring
- **Structured exports** - Pydantic-schema exports for migrations and compliance
- **Export instructions** - Guide conflict resolution and data formatting
- **Platform UI exports** - One-off manual downloads via dashboard

This covers data portability, GDPR compliance, system migrations, and manual reviews.

---

## Summary

Use **`get_all()`** for bulk retrieval, **`search()`** for specific questions, and **`create_memory_export()`** for structured data exports with custom schemas. Remember exports expire after 7 days—download them locally for long-term archives.
