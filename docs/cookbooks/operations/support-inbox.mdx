You can create a personalized Customer Support AI Agent using Mem0. This guide walks through the necessary steps and provides complete code to get you started.

## Overview

The Customer Support AI Agent leverages Mem0 to retain information across interactions, enabling a personalized and efficient support experience.

## Setup

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install openai mem0ai
```

## Full Code Example

```ts
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { Memory } from "mem0ai/oss";

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

class CustomerSupportAIAgent {
  private memory: Memory;
  private appId = "customer-support";

  constructor() {
    this.memory = new Memory({
      vectorStore: {
        provider: "qdrant",
        config: {
          host: "localhost",
          port: 6333,
        },
      },
    });
  }

  async handleQuery(query: string, userId?: string): Promise<void> {
    // Store the query in memory
    await this.memory.add(query, { userId, metadata: { appId: this.appId } });

    // Stream a response from the AI
    const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o-mini",
      stream: true,
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a customer support AI agent." },
        { role: "user", content: query },
      ],
    });

    for await (const chunk of stream) {
      const delta = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content;
      if (delta) process.stdout.write(delta);
    }
    console.log();
  }

  async getMemories(userId?: string) {
    return this.memory.getAll({ userId });
  }
}

// Usage
const supportAgent = new CustomerSupportAIAgent();
const customerId = "jane_doe";

await supportAgent.handleQuery(
  "I need help with my recent order. It hasn't arrived yet.",
  customerId
);
```

### Fetching Memories

```ts
const memories = await supportAgent.getMemories(customerId);
for (const m of memories.results) {
  console.log(m.memory);
}
```

### Key Points

- **Initialization**: The `CustomerSupportAIAgent` class is initialized with memory configuration and OpenAI client setup.
- **Handling Queries**: The `handleQuery` method stores the query in memory and streams a response from the AI.
- **Retrieving Memories**: The `getMemories` method fetches all stored memories associated with a customer.

### Conclusion

As the conversation progresses, Mem0's memory automatically updates based on interactions, providing a continuously improving personalized support experience.
