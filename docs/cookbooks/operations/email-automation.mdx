This guide demonstrates how to build an intelligent email processing system using Mem0's memory capabilities. You'll learn how to store, categorize, retrieve, and analyze emails to create a smart email management solution.

## Overview

Email overload is a common challenge for many professionals. By leveraging Mem0's memory capabilities, you can build an intelligent system that:

- Stores emails as searchable memories
- Categorizes emails automatically
- Retrieves relevant past conversations
- Prioritizes messages based on importance
- Generates summaries and action items

## Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install mem0ai openai
```

## Implementation

### Basic Email Memory System

The following example shows how to create a basic email processing system with Mem0:

```typescript
import MemoryClient from 'mem0ai';

const client = new MemoryClient({ apiKey: process.env.MEM0_API_KEY! });

class EmailProcessor {
  /** Parse a raw RFC-2822 email string into headers + body. */
  private parseEmail(raw: string) {
    const [headerSection, ...bodyParts] = raw.split(/\r?\n\r?\n/);
    const headers: Record<string, string> = {};
    for (const line of headerSection.split(/\r?\n/)) {
      const idx = line.indexOf(':');
      if (idx !== -1) headers[line.slice(0, idx).toLowerCase().trim()] = line.slice(idx + 1).trim();
    }
    return { headers, body: bodyParts.join('\n\n').trim() };
  }

  async processEmail(emailContent: string, userId: string) {
    const { headers, body } = this.parseEmail(emailContent);

    const message = {
      role: 'user' as const,
      content: `Email from ${headers['from']}: ${headers['subject']}\n\n${body}`,
    };

    const metadata = {
      email_type: 'incoming',
      sender: headers['from'],
      recipient: headers['to'],
      subject: headers['subject'],
      date: headers['date'],
    };

    return await client.add([message], {
      userId,
      metadata,
      categories: ['email', 'correspondence'],
    });
  }

  async searchEmails(query: string, userId: string, sender?: string) {
    const andConditions: any[] = [
      { user_id: userId },
      { categories: { contains: 'email' } },
    ];
    if (sender) andConditions.push({ sender });

    return await client.search(query, { filters: { AND: andConditions } });
  }

  async getEmailThread(subject: string, userId: string) {
    return await client.getAll({
      filters: {
        AND: [
          { user_id: userId },
          { categories: { contains: 'email' } },
          { subject: { icontains: subject } },
        ],
      },
    });
  }
}

// Initialize the processor
const processor = new EmailProcessor();

// Example raw email
const sampleEmail = `From: alice@example.com
To: bob@example.com
Subject: Meeting Schedule Update
Date: Mon, 15 Jul 2024 14:22:05 -0700

Hi Bob,

I wanted to update you on the schedule for our upcoming project meeting.
We'll be meeting this Thursday at 2pm instead of Friday.

Could you please prepare your section of the presentation?

Thanks,
Alice
`;

const userId = 'bob@example.com';
await processor.processEmail(sampleEmail, userId);

// Later, search for emails about meetings
const meetingEmails = await processor.searchEmails('meeting schedule', userId);
console.log(`Found ${meetingEmails.results.length} relevant emails`);
```

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Long-term Email Memory**: Store and retrieve email conversations across long periods
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant emails even if they don't contain exact keywords
- **Intelligent Categorization**: Automatically sort emails into meaningful categories
- **Action Item Extraction**: Identify and track tasks mentioned in emails
- **Priority Management**: Focus on important emails based on AI-determined priority
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain thread context for more relevant interactions

## Conclusion

By combining Mem0's memory capabilities with email processing, you can create intelligent email management systems that help users organize, prioritize, and act on their inbox effectively. The advanced capabilities like automatic categorization, action item extraction, and priority management can significantly reduce the time spent on email management, allowing users to focus on more important tasks.
