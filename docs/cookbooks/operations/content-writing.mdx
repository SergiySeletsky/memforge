description: "Store voice guidelines once and apply them across every draft."

This guide demonstrates how to leverage **Mem0** to streamline content writing by applying your unique writing style and preferences using persistent memory.

## Why Use Mem0?

Integrating Mem0 into your writing workflow helps you:

1. **Store persistent writing preferences** ensuring consistent tone, formatting, and structure.
2. **Automate content refinement** by retrieving preferences when rewriting or reviewing content.
3. **Scale your writing style** so it applies consistently across multiple documents or sessions.

## Setup

```bash
npm install mem0ai openai
```

```typescript
import MemoryClient from 'mem0ai';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new MemoryClient({ apiKey: process.env.MEM0_API_KEY! });
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

const USER_ID = 'content_writer';
const RUN_ID = 'smart_editing_session';
```

## Storing Your Writing Preferences in Mem0

```typescript
async function storeWritingPreferences(): Promise<void> {
  const preferences = `My writing preferences:
1. Use headings and sub-headings for structure.
2. Keep paragraphs concise (8–10 sentences max).
3. Incorporate specific numbers and statistics.
4. Provide concrete examples.
5. Use bullet points for clarity.
6. Avoid jargon and buzzwords.`;

  const messages = [
    { role: 'user', content: 'Here are my writing style preferences.' },
    { role: 'assistant', content: preferences },
  ];

  await client.add(messages, {
    user_id: USER_ID,
    run_id: RUN_ID,
    metadata: { type: 'preferences', category: 'writing_style' },
  });
}
```

## Editing Content Using Stored Preferences

```typescript
async function applyWritingStyle(originalContent: string): Promise<string | null> {
  const results = await client.search(
    'What are my writing style preferences?',
    {
      filters: {
        AND: [
          { user_id: USER_ID },
          { run_id: RUN_ID },
        ],
      },
    }
  );

  if (!results || results.results.length === 0) {
    console.log('No preferences found.');
    return null;
  }

  const preferences = results.results.map((r: any) => r.memory).join('\n');

  const systemPrompt = `You are a writing assistant.

Apply the following writing style preferences to improve the user's content:

Preferences:
${preferences}`;

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
      { role: 'user', content: `Original Content:\n${originalContent}` },
    ],
  });

  return response.choices[0].message.content?.trim() ?? null;
}
```

## Complete Workflow: Content Editing

```typescript
async function contentWritingWorkflow(content: string): Promise<string> {
  // Store writing preferences (ideally done once)
  await storeWritingPreferences();

  const editedContent = await applyWritingStyle(content);
  if (!editedContent) return 'Failed to edit document.';

  console.log('\n=== ORIGINAL DOCUMENT ===\n');
  console.log(content);
  console.log('\n=== EDITED DOCUMENT ===\n');
  console.log(editedContent);

  return editedContent;
}
```

## Example Usage

```typescript
const originalContent = `Project Proposal
