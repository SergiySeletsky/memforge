## Overview

Organizations and projects provide multi-tenant support, access control, and team collaboration capabilities for Mem0 Platform. Use these APIs to build applications that support multiple teams, customers, or isolated environments.

<Info>
Organizations and projects are **optional** features. You can use Mem0 without them for single-user or simple multi-user applications.
</Info>

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-org/project Support**: Specify organization and project when initializing the Mem0 client to attribute API usage appropriately
- **Member Management**: Control access to data through organization and project membership
- **Access Control**: Only members can access memories and data within their organization/project scope
- **Team Isolation**: Maintain data separation between different teams and projects for secure collaboration

---

## Using Organizations & Projects

### Initialize with Org/Project Context

Example with the mem0 TypeScript package:

```javascript
import { MemoryClient } from "mem0ai";
const client = new MemoryClient({
  organizationId: "YOUR_ORG_ID",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
});
```

---

## Project Management

The Mem0 client provides comprehensive project management through the `client.project` interface:

### Get Project Details

Retrieve information about the current project:

```typescript
// Get all project details
const projectInfo = await client.project.get();

// Get specific fields only
const projectInfo = await client.project.get({ fields: ["name", "description", "customCategories"] });
```

### Create a New Project

Create a new project within your organization:

```typescript
// Create a project with name and description
const newProject = await client.project.create({
  name: "My New Project",
  description: "A project for managing customer support memories"
});
```

### Update Project Settings

Modify project configuration including custom instructions, categories, and graph settings:

```typescript
// Update project with custom categories
await client.project.update({
  customCategories: [
    { customer_preferences: "Customer likes, dislikes, and preferences" },
    { support_history: "Previous support interactions and resolutions" }
  ]
});

// Update project with custom instructions
await client.project.update({ customInstructions: "..." });

// Enable graph memory for the project
await client.project.update({ enableGraph: true });

// Update multiple settings at once
await client.project.update({
  customInstructions: "...",
  customCategories: [
    { personal_info: "User personal information and preferences" },
    { work_context: "Professional context and work-related information" }
  ],
  enableGraph: true
});
```

### Delete Project

<Warning>
This action will remove all memories, messages, and other related data in the project. **This operation is irreversible.**
</Warning>

Remove a project and all its associated data:

```typescript
// Delete the current project (irreversible)
const result = await client.project.delete();
```

---

## Member Management

Manage project members and their access levels:

```typescript
// Get all project members
const members = await client.project.getMembers();

// Add a new member as a reader
await client.project.addMember({
  email: "colleague@company.com",
  role: "READER" // or "OWNER"
});

// Update a member's role
await client.project.updateMember({
  email: "colleague@company.com",
  role: "OWNER"
});

// Remove a member from the project
await client.project.removeMember({ email: "colleague@company.com" });
```

### Member Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **READER** | Can view and search memories, but cannot modify project settings or manage members |
| **OWNER** | Full access including project modification, member management, and all reader permissions |

---

## Async Support

All project methods return Promises and support async/await:

```typescript
import { MemoryClient } from "mem0ai";

async function manageProject() {
  const client = new MemoryClient({
    apiKey: process.env.MEM0_API_KEY!,
    organizationId: "YOUR_ORG_ID",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
  });

  // All methods support async/await
  const projectInfo = await client.project.get();
  await client.project.update({ enableGraph: true });
  const members = await client.project.getMembers();
}

manageProject();
```
